        <h1>Interactive Aggregation Demo</h1>

        <p>This demo shows how to analyze a graph by aggregating groups of nodes.</p>
        <p>
          Via the context menu, groups of nodes of the same color or shape can be aggregated giving
          different insights about the graph.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, aggregating all nodes by <em>shape and color</em> shows that there are no
          connections between rectangle shaped nodes of different color and no connections between
          octagonal green and purple nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demo makes use of the <em>AggregationGraphWrapper</em> class, that allows for
          aggregating graph items by hiding items and adding new items to a wrapped graph.
        </p>
        <h2>Things to Try</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Right click on a node to open a <em>context menu</em> with the different aggregation and
            expansion options.
          </li>
          <li>
            Aggregate all nodes with the <em>same shape or color</em> by selecting "Aggregate Nodes
            with Same ...".
          </li>
          <li><em>Separate</em> an aggregation node again by selecting "Separate".</li>
          <li>
            Right click on an empty location on the canvas and select "Aggregate All Nodes by ..."
            to <em>group all nodes</em> by shape or color.
          </li>
          <li>
            Right click on an empty location on the canvas and select "Separate All" to show the
            whole graph again.
          </li>
