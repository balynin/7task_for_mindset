/**
 * A layout stage that tries to align a specified set of nodes by using critical edge
 * priorities when the core layout is {@link HierarchicLayout}.
 *
 * This sample shows how to define a custom {@link IDataProvider} key which is used to define
 * data for this layout stage. In this case, the data is boolean and defines whether or
 * not a node is part of the alignment nodes set.
 *
 * Furthermore, it demonstrates how a graph can be pre-processed before the core layout and
 * post-processed (restored) afterwards. In the pre-processing step, dummy elements (in this
 * case edges) are inserted and the data registered at key
 * {@link HierarchicLayout.CRITICAL_EDGE_PRIORITY_DP_KEY} must be wrapped to realize the alignment.
 * In the restoration step, the dummy elements are removed and the data is restored accordingly.
 *
 * This general approach (pre-processing, core layout, post-processing) can be used for many
 * scenarios where a custom layout stage is required.
 * Inserting temporary elements is an effective way to influence the layout result and customize
 * them to specific requirements. Keeping temporary elements only inside the layout graph and
 * using a custom stage has the huge advantages that no additional view graph ({@link IGraph})
 * elements must be created and that only a single layout run on the view graph is required,
 * thus, not affecting the layout animation.
