          <h1>Jest Puppeteer Demo</h1>

          <p>
            The Jest Puppeteer demo shows how to use
            <a href="https://jestjs.io/en/" target="_blank">Jest</a> for integration testing a
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> application that uses yFiles
            for HTML.
          </p>

          <p>To start the demo and run the integration tests:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Go to the demo's directory <code>demos-js/testing/jest-puppeteer</code>.</li>
            <li>Run <code>npm install</code>.</li>
            <li>Start the demo: Run <code>npm run start-test</code>.</li>
            <li>Run the integration tests: <code>npm run test:integration</code>.</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            The demo starts with an empty graph, but graph items can be created interactively. The
            integration tests test this functionality by simulating node, edge and port creation
            gestures and verifying that the graph instance actually contains the newly created graph
            items.
          </p>

          <p>
            The tests run in a
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/smooth-code/jest-puppeteer"
              >puppeteer environment</a
            >
            instead of the default
            <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom">jsdom</a>
            environment, because yFiles for HTML needs a fully HTML5 compliant browser environment,
            which jsdom does not provide (in particular, jsdom lacks a complete SVG DOM
            implementation).
          </p>
          <p>With puppeteer, the tests can run in a full Chrome headless environment instead.</p>

          <p>
            In order to obtain access to the yFiles API, in particular for access to the
            <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphComponent" target="_blank">GraphComponent</a> instance through <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/CanvasComponent#getComponent" target="_blank">CanvasComponent#getComponent</a>, this
            sample introduces an environment variable that causes the application code to expose the
            yFiles API to the global scope.
