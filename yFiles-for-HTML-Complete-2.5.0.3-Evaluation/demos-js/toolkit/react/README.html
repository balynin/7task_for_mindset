          </div>

          <h1>React Demo</h1>

          <p>
            The React demo shows how to integrate yFiles in a basic
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React</a> application based on
            <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/" target="_blank"
              >Create React App</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>To start the demo</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Go to the demo's directory <code>demos-js/toolkit/react</code>.</li>
            <li>Run <code>npm install</code>.</li>
            <li>Run <code>npm run start</code>.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This will start the development server of the toolkit.</p>

          <p>
            The integrated development server of the project will automatically update the
            application upon code changes.
          </p>

          <div class="info-box">
            Note: The <code>/.env/</code> file with <code>SKIP_PREFLIGHT_CHECK=true</code> is only
            necessary due to the version mismatch of eslint for the react-scripts and the yFiles
            demo package. If you use the source code of this application outside of the yFiles demo
            package tree, this file won't be necessary.
          </div>

          <h1>Deploying React with yFiles</h1>

          <p>
            There are no special caveats that you need to look out for when you load yFiles as NPM
            dependency as in this demo application. However, we recommend to include the
            <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@yworks/optimizer" target="_blank"
              >@yworks/optimizer</a
            >
            when you deploy your app for production.
          </p>
          <p>
            The optimizer will obfuscate the public API of the yFiles module files, as well as
            yFiles API usages in application sources.
          </p>
          <p>
            We highly recommend obfuscating the yFiles for HTML library prior to deploying your
            application to a public web server to reduce the download size of the library for the
            end user. Note that, at the time of writing, you are not required to use obfuscation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Here is how you can include the <code>@yworks/optimizer</code> in this application that
            was built with the
            <a href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/" target="_blank"
              >Create React App</a
            >
            toolkit.
          </p>

          <ol>
            <li>
              Run <code>npm run eject</code> to gain the full control over the deployment of this
              application. See also
              <a
                href="https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject"
                target="_blank"
                >npm run eject</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then install the dependencies that are necessary to build JSX files, i.e.<br />
              <code
                >npm install --save @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx
                @babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx-source</code
              ><br />
              Now, the application can be started and built with either
              <code>npm run start</code> or <code>npm run build</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Then we need the <code>@yworks/optimizer</code> dependency, which you can install
              with:<br />
              <code>npm install --save-dev @yworks/optimizer</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              To include the <code>@yworks/optimizer</code> in the build process for production
              builds, prepend the following plugin in <code>/config/webpack.config.js</code>:
              <pre>
plugins: [
  isEnvProduction && new yWorksOptimizer({
    blacklist: ['render', 'Component', 'nodesSource', 'edgesSource']
  }),
  ...
]
        </pre
              >
              Don't forget to require it first:<br />
              <code>const yWorksOptimizer = require('@yworks/optimizer/webpack-plugin')</code>
            </li>
            <li>
              That's it. When you now build for production with <code>npm run build</code>, the
              optimizer will do its job and the bundle will be obfuscated.
            </li>
