          <h1>Demo Utility Files</h1>

          <p>
            The files in this directory implement demo features that are used in more than one
            specific demo. Like other demo code, you can use these files in your own project if it
            fits your needs.
          </p>

          <h4>ContextMenu.js</h4>
          <p>
            A simple context menu that provides methods to add context menu entries with specific
            listeners and means to open or close the context menu. It is used in any demo that
            requires a context menu and is especially featured in the
            <a href="../input/contextmenu/index.html">Context Menu</a> demo.
          </p>

          <h4>DndPanel.js</h4>
          <p>
            A drag and drop panel which can be used to populate a given element with node visuals
            and the necessary listeners. This panel is demonstrated in the
            <a href="../input/draganddrop/index.html">Drag and Drop</a> demo and is also used in any
            other demo that supports drag and drop of graph elements.
          </p>

          <h4>FileSaveSupport.js</h4>
          <p>
            Provides a static helper function to save files to the local filesystem. It makes use of
            the HTML5 file download or a proprietary approach in Internet Explorer. It is mainly
            used in the export demos, like the <a href="">Image Export</a> or
            <a href="">PDF Export</a> demo, though there is also a dedicated
            <a href="">File Operations</a> demo that illustrates how to save a GraphML file besides
            using implicit approaches with <code>ICommand.SAVE</code> or the methods of
            <code>GraphMLSupport</code>.
          </p>

          <h4>JsonIO.js</h4>
          <p>
            Contains helper classes that provide methods for JSON I/O of an <code>IGraph</code>.
            This implementation only supports de-/serialization of structural information, but it
            can be used as a starting point for including other information (e.g. item styles) as
            well.
          </p>

          <h4>VuejsNodeStyle.js</h4>
          <p>
            A template node style that leverages the powerful data binding and conditional rendering
            features of the
            <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/index.html" target="_blank">Vue.js framework</a>.
            See the corresponding
            <a
              href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/custom-styles_vuejs-template-styles"
              >template styles section in the developer's guide</a
            >
            and the
            <a href="../style/vuejstemplatenodestyle/index.html">Vue.js Template Node Style Demo</a>
            for more details.
          </p>

          <h4>Workarounds.js</h4>
          <p>
            The yFiles for HTML library contains workarounds for several bugs of specific web
            browsers. An overview can be found at
            <a
              href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/kb/article/704/Browser_issues_and_included_workarounds"
              >Browser issues and included workarounds</a
            >. This helper enables those workarounds only for the affected browsers and is used
            throughout the demos. It is recommended to check if your application's target platform
            is affected from any browser issue and enabled the specific workaround in this user
            agents.
