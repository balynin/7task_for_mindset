        <h1>EdgeRouter with Bus-style Routing</h1>

        <p>
          This demo shows how to configure the EdgeRouter to generate orthogonal bus-style routes. A
          bus is a segment shared by multiple edges. The actual nodes are attached to the bus with
          shorter segments.
        </p>

        <p>
          A bus is defined via the <em>add</em> method of the
          <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/EdgeRouterData#buses" target="_blank">buses</a> property. The method yields an object on which
          the set of edges can conveniently be defined, e.g., via a delegate.
        </p>

        <p>
          The <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/EdgeRouterBusDescriptor" target="_blank">EdgeRouterBusDescriptor</a> class provided to the <em>add</em> method offers
          settings related to a bus.
        </p>

        <p>This example showcases two buses which are defined differently.</p>

        <h3>First Bus - Automatic Backbone</h3>
        <p>
          The first bus (<span style="color: #ff6c00; font-weight: bold">orange graph</span>) is
          defined using a default descriptor and with no further settings. This means that the
          algorithm automatically chooses backbone segments.
        </p>

        <h3>Second Bus - Given Points</h3>
        <p>
          The second bus (<span style="color: #242265; font-weight: bold">blue graph</span>) is
          defined by
          <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/EdgeRouterBusDescriptor#busPoints" target="_blank">manually providing</a>
          the location of the backbone segments. The manually defined backbone consists of a
          vertical segment to the left of the nodes and two horizontal segments in-between the node
          rows.
        </p>

        <h3>Code Snippet</h3>

        <p>
          You can copy the code snippet to configure the layout from
          <a
            href="https://github.com/yWorks/yfiles-for-html-demos/blob/master/demos/04-tutorial-layout-features/edge-router-buses/EdgeRouterBuses.ts"
            target="_blank"
            >GitHub</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h3>Demos</h3>

        <p>
          The <a href="../../layout/busrouting/index.html">Bus Routing Demo</a> is a more complex
          demo that shows the bus-style routing feature. More features offered by the EdgeRouter
          algorithm are shown by the
          <a href="../../layout/layoutstyles/index.html?layout=edge-router&amp;sample=edge-router"
            >Layout Styles Demo</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h3>Documentation</h3>

        <p>
          The Developer's Guide provides more information about the concepts of the
          <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/polyline_router_bus_routing" target="_blank">Bus-style routing</a> feature of the
          EdgeRouter.
