        <h1>Reshape Handle Provider Configuration Demo</h1>

        <p>This demo shows how resizing of nodes can be customized.</p>

        <p>
          This is done with custom configurations of the default
          <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/IReshapeHandleProvider" target="_blank">IReshapeHandleProvider</a> that are added to the lookup of the nodes.
        </p>

        <h2>Things to Try</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Select and resize the nodes.</li>
          <li>Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> to keep the aspect ratio for any node.</li>
          <li>Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> to resize around the node's center.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Node Types</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em class="demo-bold">Red nodes</em> cannot be resized. They don't display resize
            handles.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em class="demo-bold">Green nodes</em> show only four handles at the corners. During
            resizing, these handles always maintain the aspect ratio of the node.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em class="demo-bold">Dark blue nodes</em> show only one handle in the bottom right
            corner. During resizing, this handle always maintains the center of the node.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em class="demo-bold">Purple nodes</em> show four handles at the corners and four
            different handles at the sides. During resizing, the corner handles always maintain the
            aspect ratio of the node while the border handles don't.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em class="demo-bold">Orange nodes</em> cannot extend beyond the black rectangle. Note
            that orange nodes can only be resized so that the new bounding box stays withing the
            bounding black rectangle.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em class="demo-bold">Light blue nodes</em> combine the behavior of the orange and green
            nodes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em class="demo-bold">Golden nodes</em> maintain their aspect ratio depending on some
            application state. This state can be toggled by clicking one of the handles of a golden
            node.
          </li>
