        <h1>Lasso Selection Demo</h1>

        <p>
          This demo shows how to configure <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/LassoSelectionInputMode" target="_blank">LassoSelectionInputMode</a> for lasso selection
          mode. In this mode, graph items can be selected very flexible by dragging a lasso line
          around them.
        </p>

        <h2>Things to Try</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Switch between the selection styles:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Free-hand lasso selection will create a curved line while dragging and select the
                items when releasing the mouse button
              </li>
              <li>
                Polyline lasso selection will start a segment while dragging and create a bend when
                releasing the mouse button. The selection is finished when the mouse button is
                released within the radius around the start point or on double-click.
              </li>
              <li>
                Marquee selection is the default selection style in <em>yFiles for HTML</em>. It is
                used as a reference here.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Adjust the finish radius: When the mouse-button is released at the start point, the
            selection is finished. The finish radius determines how close to the start point this
            must happen.
          </li>
          <li>
            Select different conditions to select nodes:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Select Intersected Nodes: Nodes will end up in the selection if the lasso contains
                or at least intersects with their layout.
              </li>
              <li>
                Select Complete Nodes: Nodes will only be selected if the lasso completely contains
                them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Select Node's Center: The selection will only contain nodes whose center is inside
                the lasso line.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>Note that on touch devices the selection gesture starts with a long press.</p>
