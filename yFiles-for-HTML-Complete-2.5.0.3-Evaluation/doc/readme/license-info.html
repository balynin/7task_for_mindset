              <a href="legal/SOFTWARE_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.html" target="_blank"
                >Software License Agreement for yFiles for HTML</a

              <div class="list-header">Redistributable(s) in the evaluation packages</div>
              There are no Redistributable(s) in the evaluation package. The evaluation version of
              yFiles for HTML is for evaluation purposes only. You are not entitled to distribute any of
              the files included in the evaluation version of yFiles for HTML as part of your software or
              otherwise.

            <li class="extra-margin">
              <div class="list-header">Redistributable(s) in purchased yFiles for HTML packages</div>
              The files in the directory <code>lib</code> are the Redistributable(s) as mentioned in
              Section 2 in the
              <a href="legal/SOFTWARE_LICENSE_AGREEMENT.html" target="_blank">license agreement</a>.
              <br /><br />
              Licensees of yFiles for HTML are entitled to deliver Redistributable(s) as part of their own
              software applications as specified in the license agreement.
            </li>
            <li class="extra-margin">
              <div class="list-header">Third party code and licenses</div>
              Neither the Redistributable(s) of yFiles for HTML nor the included demos contain any
              third-party libraries or code.
            </li>
            <li class="extra-margin">
              <div class="list-header">yFiles license mechanism for app distribution</div>
              Apart from the abovementioned Redistributable(s), in order to run, a yFiles for HTML
              application needs a valid license.
              <br /><br />
              Evaluation versions of yFiles for HTML come with a pre-generated evaluation license file
              that is located in
              <code>lib/license.json</code>. You can include this file in any HTML page that uses
              the library. <br /><br />
              See the
              <a href="../api/index.html#/dguide/licensing" target="_blank">Licensing section</a> in
              the Developer's Guide for additional information.
            </li>
            <li>
              <div class="list-header">Optimization and Obfuscation</div>
              Before distributing your application, we highly recommend that you obfuscate and
              minify the resulting application. This reduces the download size of the library files
              for your end users and protects your intellectual property by making the application
              source code harder to read.
              <br /><br />
              The top-level directory <code>deployment</code> contains the yFiles deployment tool
              that provides name obfuscation and minification especially for the yFiles for HTML
              library, amongst others. For more details, see the
              <a href="../../deployment/README.html" target="_blank"
