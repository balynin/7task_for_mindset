        <h1>Interactive Graph Restructuring Demo</h1>

        <p>A demo that shows how to interactively relocate subtrees from one parent to another.</p>
        <p>
          Every time that a node is selected, the subtree rooted at this particular node is dragged
          interactively, and
          <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/ClearAreaLayout" target="_blank">ClearAreaLayout</a> will try to create free space by pushing away the other
          elements of the graph so that the dragged subtree is relocated to another parent.
        </p>
        <h2>Things to Try</h2>
        <p>
          Drag a node with its subtree to another location and see how the graph tries to
          accommodate it. The node that is highlighted will be the new parent of the moved subtree.
