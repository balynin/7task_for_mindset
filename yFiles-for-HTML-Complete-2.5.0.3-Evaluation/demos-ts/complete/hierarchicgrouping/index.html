        <h1>Hierarchic Grouping Demo</h1>

        <p>
          The Hierarchic Grouping demo shows how to nicely expand and collapse sub-graphs organized
          in groups. Folding ('collapsed groups') can help to keep complex hierarchically organized
          diagrams clear and straightforward by showing only parts of the entire structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, each user action triggers a run of the <em>incremental mode</em> of the
          <em>hierarchic layout algorithm</em> to ensure that the currently visible part of the
          graph is always well-organized but remains still similar to the previous arrangement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recursive edges are edges whose source is inside a group node while its target is outside
          this group node, and vice versa. When those edges leave a group node at the side to reach
          a node left or right of the group node, information to keep the layout stable after
          expanding/collapsing the group node may be lost.<br />
          Therefore, a new routing style is introduced which will preserve this information. This
          routing style forces all edges to enter groups at the top and leave them at the bottom.
        </p>
