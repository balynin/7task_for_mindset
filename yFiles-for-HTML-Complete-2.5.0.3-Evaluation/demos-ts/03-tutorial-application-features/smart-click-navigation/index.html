        <h1>Smart Click Navigation</h1>

        <p>
          This demos shows how to navigate in a large graph, especially when only a part of the
          graph is visible in the viewport.
        </p>
        <h3>Things To Try</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Click on an <b>edge</b> whose target node or source node is not visible. Then you will
            notice that the focus will be moved to this source or target node.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click on an <b>edge</b> where both target and source node are visible. Then you will
            notice that the focus will be moved to the middle point of the edge.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click on a <b>node</b> and you will notice that the focus will be moved to the center of
            the clicked node.
          </li>
          <li>
            Choose between two modes in the combo box:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <em>Zoom to Viewport Center.</em> The focused item is in the center of the viewport.
              </li>
              <li>
                <em>Zoom to Mouse Location.</em> The focused item is centered at the mouse location.
              </li>
            </ul>
