        <h1>Orthogonal Edge Editing Demo</h1>

        <p>This demo shows the customization of orthogonal edge editing.</p>

        <p>
          Using the <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphDecorator" target="_blank">GraphDecorator</a>, the edge is decorated with custom implementations of
          the <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/IOrthogonalEdgeHelper" target="_blank">IOrthogonalEdgeHelper</a> interface.
        </p>

        <h2>Things to Try</h2>

        <p>Drag segments and bends of the edges and observe the different characteristics.</p>

        <h2>Edge Types</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <em class="demo-red demo-bold">Red edge</em>: Orthogonal edge editing is disabled. The
            segments are straight lines with arbitrary slope. Dragging an unselected segment creates
            a new bend.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em class="demo-green demo-bold">Green edge</em>: Orthogonal edge editing is enabled.
            While dragging, all segments stay orthogonal and new bends are created as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em class="demo-purple demo-bold">Purple edge</em>: Same behavior as the green edge. In
            addition, the locations of the source port and target port are constraint to the given
            port candidates of the nodes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em class="demo-orange demo-bold">Orange edge</em>: Same behavior as the green edge. In
            addition, the source port and the target port can be placed at any location inside the
            node since they use dynamic port candidates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em class="demo-palette-510 demo-bold">Yellow edge</em>: Same behavior as the green
            edge. In addition, dragging the first (or last) segment of the edge will create only one
            new bend instead of two.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em class="demo-blue demo-bold">Blue edge</em>: Orthogonal edge editing is enabled for
            the inner segments but the first and the last segment can have an arbitrary slope. If a
            new bend is added to one of these two segments, the newly created inner segment becomes
            orthogonal immediately.
