        <h1>Single Selection Demo</h1>

        <p>
          This demo shows how to configure <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/GraphEditorInputMode" target="_blank">GraphEditorInputMode</a> for single selection
          mode. In this mode, only one graph item can be selected at a time.
        </p>

        <h2>Things to Try</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Toggle single selection mode and examine the differences.</li>
          <li>
            Select a single node and toggle its selection state by pressing <code>Ctrl-Space</code>.
            This works in both single selection and regular mode due to a custom command binding.
          </li>
          <li>
            Move the node focus (indicated by a thin dashed line) by holding down
            <code>Ctrl</code> and pressing an arrow key. Toggle the selection state of the focused
            item by pressing <code>Ctrl-Space</code>.
          </li>
          <li>Take a look at the source code, especially method <em>enableSingleSelection</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Features of Single Selection Mode</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Marquee selection is disabled. Try to drag the mouse over a set of nodes to select them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Click-selecting multiple nodes is disabled. Try to extend the selection by holding the
            <code>Ctrl</code>
            key while clicking another node.
          </li>
          <li>
            <em>Select All</em> is disabled. Try to select all nodes by pressing
            <code>Ctrl-A</code>.
          </li>
