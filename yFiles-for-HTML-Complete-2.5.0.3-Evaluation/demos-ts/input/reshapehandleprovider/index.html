        <h1>Reshape Handle Provider Demo</h1>

        <p>This demo shows how to implement a custom <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/IReshapeHandleProvider" target="_blank">IReshapeHandleProvider</a>.</p>

        <p>
          This <em>IReshapeHandleProvider</em> is provided for ports to reshape their port
          visualization.
        </p>

        <h2>Things to Try</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Select a <em class="green">green</em> or <em class="blue">blue</em> port and see its
            reshape handles at its corners. Also note that there is a different handle at the center
            that was provided by the <em>IHandleProvider</em> to change the port location.
          </li>
          <li>
            Drag one of the reshape handles to change the size of the port visualization. Note that
            the size can't be decreased below a specific minimum size.
          </li>
          <li>
            Press and hold <strong>Ctrl</strong> and see that further reshape handles appear on the
            left, right, top and bottom side of selected ports. These handles reshape the port
            either horizontally or vertically.
          </li>
