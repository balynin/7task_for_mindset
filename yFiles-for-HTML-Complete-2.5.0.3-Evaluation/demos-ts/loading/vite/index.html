        <h1>Vite Loading Demo</h1>
        <p>
          This demo shows how to load yFiles for HTML with
          <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vite</a> as a loader for
          efficient web development and easy builds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also a layout algorithm in a Web Worker thread without blocking the UI or main thread is
          loaded using
          <a
            href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#web-workers"
            rel="noopener"
            target="_blank"
            >Vite's built-in support for Web Workers</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wait for the demo to load and once the layout button has become active (when the Web
          Worker has initialized), push the layout button to run a layout asynchronously
        </p>
        <p>See the sources for details.</p>
        <p>
          Please note that the hot reloading features of this demo are completely
          <b>optional</b> and definitely not required when using yFiles for HTML with vite. They are only
          meant to show a simple example of hot reloading.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demo code uses
          <a href="https://web.dev/module-workers/" target="_blank">module workers</a>. Vite's
          development build relies on browser native support and therefore currently only works in
          some browser (e.g. Chrome). For unsupported browsers, client-sided layout calculation is
          used as fallback.
        </p>
        <p>Please see the <a href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/testing-vitest" target="_blank">Vitest</a>
          section of the developer's guide for details about using the Vitest framework with your
          yFiles for HTML application.
