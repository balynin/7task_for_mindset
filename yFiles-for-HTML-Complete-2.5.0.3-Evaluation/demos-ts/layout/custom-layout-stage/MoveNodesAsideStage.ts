/**
 * A layout stage that excludes nodes with a special tag
 * (`{ moveAside: boolean }`) from the core layout
 * and instead moves those nodes to the side of the resulting layout.
 *
 * This sample demonstrates how to use properties of the original graph to do
 * something in the layout (which has a different graph model).
 *
 * It also demonstrates how a layout stage works in general that performs its core
 * layout only on a part of the original graph. This often also requires that the
 * excluded items have to be placed some other way, and also that adjacent edges may
 * have to be re-routed to get a consistent result in the end.
 *
 * A similar approach is used by layout stages like TreeReductionStage (which
 * temporarily removes non-tree edges), HideGroupNodesStage (which pretends that
 * no group nodes exist), SubgraphLayoutStage, and others.
